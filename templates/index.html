			Beautiful is better than ugly.
			<br />Explicit is better than implicit.
			<br />Simple is better than complex.
			<br />Complex is better than complicated.
			<br />Flat is better than nested.
			<br />Sparse is better than dense.
			<br />Readability counts.
			<br />Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
			<br />Although practicality beats purity.
			<br />Errors should never pass silently.
			<br />Unless explicitly silenced.
			<br />In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
			<br />There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
			<br />Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
			<br />Now is better than never.
			<br />Although never is often better than *right* now.
			<br />If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
			<br />If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
			<br />Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
